# The Beast

The beast is an experimental, flexible, declarative-oriented toolkit to read
machinereadable data from the various sources and transform them into follow the money entities.

Do not rely on this one until it is out of alpha. Everything is very volatile 


## More reading
The FTM proposal:

The sample mapping with tons of comments to make you understand an idea better (beware, it's just an example, format is the subject to change):
https://github.com/dchaplinsky/thebeast/blob/main/thebeast/tests/sample/mappings/ukrainian_mps.yaml

Validator for the mappings in [json schema](https://json-schema.org) format (again, work in progress and tons of comments):
https://github.com/dchaplinsky/thebeast/blob/main/thebeast/conf/mapping_validator.json

First proposal of the mapping (obsolete, but can give you a better idea)
